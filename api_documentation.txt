The api returns a single random quote/funfact based on the url received.
If the url contains a supercategory that has a subcategory, but the url does not specify the subclass
(i.e. /api/<supercategory>), then a random quote/funfact from a random subcategory is returned.
If the url contains a subcategory that has a parameter, but the url does not specify the parameter
(i.e. /api/<supercategory>/<subcategory>), then a random quote/funfact based on a random parameter is returned.
If the url is only the root url (i.e. /api), then a completely random quote/funfact from the entire api
is returned.

The api is currently set to run on port 5000 on the localhost.
The command for running the api is 'python api.py', where the api.py is the api file. Make sure you are in
the correct folder!
